Maximum Separating Rectangle Problem - 
 It is a variation of the Maximum Inner Rectangle problem and is NP-hard. There is no known polynomial-time algorithm for solving the problem, but there are several approximate and heuristic approaches that have been proposed, including the use of linear programming, genetic algorithms, and branch-and-bound techniques.
